BlitzBand is not a real brand, but included is a demo catalog of wearable health-tracking monitor bands from Nike, FitBit, and Garmin. The Ottemo offices are located directly across the CenturyLink Field, the home of the Seattle Seahawks, whose mascot is called Blitz, hence the name.</p><p class="text-center">The entire store, from the Store and Dash, to the backend database management and payment processing, are all written in-house at Ottemo. The store homepage, catalog, product page, are all run using the <a href="http://github.com/ottemo/store-ng">Ottemo Store-ng</a>. The Dash administrator panel is run using the <a href="http://github.com/ottemo/dash">Ottemo Dash</a>.
